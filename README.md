Admission Controller for Kubernetes OpenStackDeployment
=======================================================

Should be run under uwsgi, for example:

`$ uwsgi uwsgi.ini`

As the service runs under HTTPS, you need to also provide server certificate
and key (named oac.crt and oac.key) by default.
